# MediScan

## Overview

MediScan is a healthcare platform designed to assist doctors in accessing patient details, medical history, and allergies using image recognition technology. With MediScan, doctors can upload a patient's picture or scan their fingerprint to retrieve vital medical information, especially when the patient is unconscious or unable to communicate effectively. This platform aims to improve patient care and streamline the treatment process by providing doctors with quick and secure access to essential patient data.
